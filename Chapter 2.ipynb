    "Probability is built on the [Lesbesgue](https://www.google.com/search?q=lesbesgue+integratipon&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) theory of integration. Lesbesgue integration is similar to Riemann integration, except we focus on the y-axis instead of moving along the x-axis. To do this, we need some way of measuring the size of an interval along the x-axis that corresponds to some particular value of y. We call this function $\\mu$.\n",

Let $R$ and $B$ be the events of person **A** and person **B** getting home in time for dinner. Clearly, these two events are independent. Now, we introduce $Y$, the event of a snow storm hitting the city. Certainly, if $Y$ occurs, this will affect the probabilities of $R$ and $B$ occurring. In this scenario, both people will have a *lower* probability of making it home in time. However, the important thing to note here is that knowledge of person **A** getting home on time does *not* tell us anything about whether person **B** will get home on time (or vice-versa). We can say that $R$ and $B$ are conditionally independent, given $Y$. An example of two events that are independent but *not* conditionally independent would be: randomly sample two people **A** and **B** from the population and consider the probabilities that they will get home in time. Without further knowledge, we can reasonably assume that these events are independent. Now, if we introduce the event $Y$, which occurs if the two people live in the same neighborhood, the events $R$ and $B$ are no longer independent. If $Y$ occurs, and we know that person **A** is getting home late, then that would tend to *increase* the probability of person **B** getting home late."
